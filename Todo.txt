Challenge: Implement the delete pages for the 
- 'Book' - ()
- 'BookInstance' - (O)
- 'Genre' - (Working on....)

----------------------------------

Work in the same way as Delete Author.

- If Author has books related to them, they can't delete it.
- So...If genre has books related to them, they can't delete it either.

Then I can reference how delete author has been implemented and bring it to genre.
